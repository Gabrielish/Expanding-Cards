# Expanding-Cards

ðŸ‘‰Simple Expanding Cards using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

First card is always active and if you click on any other non active cards it will expand and withdraw last active card.

For this first i created 5 divs with each one with the exact same class and all wrapped inside a div container.
Added some css to style the container and for this i used display flex.
In javascript i created a variable to store all the divs like an array and then itterate using forEach to add 'active' class on click and created a function to delete last active class.

Hope you enjoy it.
